# Prop Placer

Allows placing in-game objects by specifying paths to copy. Use Unity Explorer to find interesting prop paths, and then use Unity Explorer to reposition any props you've placed.

Has an option to print out details for use in a New Horizons config.

This used to be a feature of New Horizons, but since it was super broken and nobody wanted to maintain it I've separated it into its own separate thing and stripped it down to its bare essentials to function.
